      <b>Cutting Down, Ramping Up: </b>
      We have a robust strategy for <s>low-hanging fruits</s> mission-critical objectives that move the needle at all costs. 
      It's time to double down on <b>revenue growth</b> while <u>cutting costs</u>. 
      This is a win-win initiative; a win for us and our amazing shareholders!

      P.S. After several strong sales months, we have decided to print <b>Employee Appreciation Tees</b>! 
      These shirts will go on sale Monday.
